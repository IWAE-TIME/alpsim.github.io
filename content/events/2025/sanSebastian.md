## Location

The meeting will be held at the [Hotel Olarain](www.olarain.com) in San Sebastian, Spain. 

## Accommodations

We will provide accommodations at the hotel Olarain. The rooms are reserved for June 23-26. These are shared rooms for two participants. We suggest you contact other workshop participants and let us know who you want to share the room with. We include a list of participants below. 

If you prefer to make separate arrangements, please let us know. We cannot guarantee it, but we might be able to partially reimburse you for the same amount we would pay at the Olarain. 

If you want to bring students or postdocs, we may have spare rooms to accommodate a few, but please consult with us before making arrangements.

We might also be able to cover some of your local expenses (we suggest you keep all your receipts).

**Disclaimer:** Some activities (e.g. reception/banquet), and reimbursements, are subject to the NSF granting us a no-cost extension. In the current unpredictable climate, we cannot guarantee that this will actually happen...Fingers crossed.  

## Meeting Schedule

The workshop will begin in the morning of the 24th, and end in the afternoon of the 26th. We may arrange for a small reception on the evening of the 23rd. We also plan a “banquet” at a local sidreria.

We will post detailed meeting schedule once we know talk topics from all participants.

## Before the Meeting

We kindly ask you that you send us the planned title of your talk at your earliest convenience, so we can plan the program. You can chose to share your latest results, or some recent computational development.  

If you are not staying for the entire duration of the workshop, please let us know your estimated arrival/departure, to put your talk in a time slot that works for you.

Some trivia: San Sebastian has the largest concentration of [Michelin star restaurants](https://discoverdonosti.com/michelin-star-restaurants/) in Europe. The famous Playa de la Concha (“Shell Beach”?) has an extension of 1350mts and is about 15 min by foot from the workshop venue. The weather can be unpredictable: you can have a beautiful sunny morning and rain in the afternoon, and sun again, and rain… (they call it “fool's rain” because you may ignore it as a thin mist, and you may get soaked). Unlike the rest of Spain, restaurants close “early” (10:30pm). There is also [good hiking](https://www.alltrails.com/spain/gipuzkoa/san-sebastian).
