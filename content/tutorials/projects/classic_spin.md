### The Ising model in two dimensions
The Ising model in two dimensions can be solved analytically. Since its properties are known, it is often used as a benchmark for numerical methods in statistical mechanics. Use the classical spin code of ALPS, 'mc', to simulate the phase transition of the model. Perform a finite size analysis, finite size scaling, and be extra careful with error analysis and error propagation.
