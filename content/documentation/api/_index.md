This manual contains a summary of the `pyalps` functions used in the ALPS tutorials. The Python API section is structure as follow:

- [Run Applications](runapp): Functions to run ALPS applications
- [Loading data](loadat): Functions to load measurements generated by specific applications
- [Evaluation](eval): Generic functions to perform data analysis, e.g. collect results and plotting.

Please refer to the [ALPS application tutorials](../../../../tutorials) to see how these functions are employed in real simulations. For example: how to scan several temperatures and plot average magnetization as a function of temperature, or how to extrapolate finite-size effects.
