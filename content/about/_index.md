ALPS is a software package for simulating correlated systems, with codes for classical spin systems, quantum spin systems, bosonic systems, and fermion systems.

## Licensing

All codes under ALPS framework are released under the MIT open-source license.

## Acknowledgements

ALPS software package results from the contributions of numerous researchers around the world in the past 20+ years. Without their efforts, the current state of the software is impossible to exist. We hope that more researchers will join us in promoting and developing this open source ecosystem to further advance ALPS's capabilities in research and education.

ALPS has been funded by many funding sources from various international funding agencies over the years. Currently, work on the maintenance of ALPS is sponsored by a grant from the US National Science Foundation under the award NSF No. 2345575.
