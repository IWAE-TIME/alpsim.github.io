title: Check Lattice Graph
toc: true

After generating a new lattice in ALPS, you might want to check that it is correct. ALPS provides a tool to generate the graph from a lattice definition in a parameter file, exactly in the same way that an ALPS program would generate it internally.
To run it, type:

    printgraph parameter_file
