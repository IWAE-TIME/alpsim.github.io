## Energy Spectra of 1D quantum systems

In this tutorial we will calculate the energy spectra of the quantum Heisenberg model on various one-dimensional lattices. The main work will be done by the `sparsediag` application, which implements the Lanczos algorithm, an iterative eigensolver.

### Heisenberg chain

#### Preparing and running the simulation from the command line

First, we look at a chain of S=1/2 spins with Heisenberg coupling. The parameter file <a href="../codes/ed-03-1dspectra/parm_chain" download>`parm_chain`</a>  sets up ED simulations for the S_z=0 sector of chains with {L=10,...16} spins.

    LATTICE = "chain lattice", 
    MODEL = "spin",
    local_S = 0.5,
    J = 1,
    CONSERVED_QUANTUMNUMBERS = "Sz"
    Sz_total = 0
    { L = 10; }
    { L = 12; }
    { L = 14; }
    { L = 16; }
    
Using the following sequence of commands you can run the diagonalization, then look at the output file `parm_chain.out.xml` with your browser.

    parameter2xml parm_chain
    sparsediag --write-xml parm_chain.in.xml

#### Preparing and running the simulation using Python

To set up and run the simulation in Python, we use the script <a href="../codes/ed-03-1dspectra/chain.py" download>`chain.py`</a>. You can run it with the convenience script `alpspython`.
Looking at the different parts of the script, we see how the input files are prepared as a list of Python dictionaries after importing the required modules.

    import pyalps
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.plot as plt
    import pyalps.plot

    parms=[]
    for l in [10, 12, 14, 16]:
        parms.append(
        { 
            'LATTICE'                   : "chain lattice", 
            'MODEL'                     : "spin",
            'local_S'                   : 0.5,
            'J'                         : 1,
            'L'                         : l,
            'CONSERVED_QUANTUMNUMBERS'  : 'Sz',
            'Sz_total'                  : 0
        }
        )
        
Next, the input parameters are written into XML job files an the `sparsediag` simulation is run.

    input_file = pyalps.writeInputFiles('parm_chain',parms)
    res = pyalps.runApplication('sparsediag',input_file)
    
For plotting the spectrum, we then load the HDF5 files produced by the simulation

    data = pyalps.loadSpectra(pyalps.getResultFiles(prefix='parm_chain'))
    
and collect the energies from all momentum sectors into one DataSet for each system size L. For getting a nice plot we additionally subtract the ground state energy from all eigenvalues and assign a label and line style to each spectrum.

    spectra = {}
    for sim in data:
        l = int(sim[0].props['L'])
        all_energies = []
        spectrum = pyalps.DataSet()
        for sec in sim:
            all_energies += list(sec.y)
            spectrum.x = np.concatenate((spectrum.x,np.array([sec.props['TOTAL_MOMENTUM'] for i in range(len(sec.y))])))
            spectrum.y = np.concatenate((spectrum.y,sec.y))
        spectrum.y -= np.min(all_energies)
        spectrum.props['line'] = 'scatter'
        spectrum.props['label'] = 'L='+str(l)
        spectra[l] = spectrum
    
Now the spectra from different system sizes can be plotted into one figure:

    plt.figure()
    pyalps.plot.plot(spectra.values())
    plt.legend()
    plt.title('Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain (S=1/2)')
    plt.ylabel('Energy')
    plt.xlabel('Momentum')
    plt.xlim(0,2*3.1416)
    plt.ylim(0,2)
    plt.show()

The plotted energy spectra for the Heisenberg chain is shown below:

### Two-leg Heisenberg ladder

With only a few small changes to the input parameters used above, we can calculate the spectrum of a two-leg ladder of Heisenberg spins. The new parameter text file <a href="../codes/ed-03-1dspectra/parm_ladder" download>`parm_ladder`</a> looks like this:

    LATTICE = "ladder"
    MODEL = "spin"
    local_S = 0.5
    J0 = 1
    J1 = 1
    CONSERVED_QUANTUMNUMBERS = "Sz"
    Sz_total = 0
    { L = 6; }
    { L = 8; }
    { L = 10; }
    
We have just replaced the "chain lattice" by a "ladder" and defined two separate coupling constants J0, J1 for the legs and the rungs, respectively. Apart from that, we have reduced the linear system size L because the ladder has 2L spins. The same changes have to be made to the Python code, which can be downloaded from here: <a href="../codes/ed-03-1dspectra/ladder.py" download>`ladder.py`</a>

The energy spectra of a Heisenberg ladder for various lattice sizes are shown below:

### Isolated dimers

If we set the coupling on the legs of the ladder J0 = 0, we get the spectrum of L isolated dimers. This is done in the parameter file <a href="../codes/ed-03-1dspectra/parm_dimers" download>`parm_dimers`</a> and the Python script <a href="../codes/ed-03-1dspectra/dimers.py" download>`dimers.py`</a>.

The energy spectra of isolated dimers are presented in the following

### Questions

- Observe how putting together spectra from different system sizes produces nice bands
- In the spectrum of the Heisenberg ladder: Identify continuum and bound states
- What is the major difference between the chain and the ladder spectrum?
- Explain the spectrum of isolated dimers
- Vary the coupling constants in the ladder and observe how the spectrum changes between the limits discussed before
- Bonus question: Have a close look at the spectrum of the chain for different system sizes: There seems to be a difference between cases where L/2 is even and those where it is odd. Can you explain this? What happens in the TDL where L goes to infinity?
